Part 1: Basic Model Checking

Copy and paste the following lines to compile and execute the code:

DIRECTORY-> javac TestModelChecking.java
DIRECTORY-> java TestModelChecking

Part 2: Advanced Propositional Inference

Copy and paste the following lines to compile and execute the code:

DIRECTORY-> javac TestDPLL.java
DIRECTORY-> java TestDPLL


Both the TestModelChecking and TestDPLL classes test each problem (with some additional test cases), and printed to the console any instances where the test fails to produce the expected result.
